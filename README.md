# Project Overview
- Open-ended project for DSC80 (The Practice and Application of Data Science) taken at UCSD
- Analyzed and visualized distribution of power outage characteristics and their correlations with outage durations
- Performed A/B Test to assess the dependency of missingness in number of customers affected on outage durations
- Conducted Hypothesis Test to evaluate whether outage events caused by severe weather affect more customers than those caused by other reasons
- Created a pipeline of engineered outage event features and Logistic Regression model to classify severe and non-severe outage with F1 score of 0.73
- Evaluated whether the model is fairer for correctly labeling severe outage in western states than those in non western states
